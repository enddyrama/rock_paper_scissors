// - Make a game of rock,paper, and scissors in a form of JS function.
// - You input your choice in the parameter of the function in a form of string, while the function will return a random choice.
// - The return of the fucntion must be according to the rule(ie. rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock, and same choice will result a tie)
// - when you put a string other than rock, paper, or scissors as the arguement, it will return an error "(string) is not part of the game!"
- when you put something other than string as the arguement, it will return an error "please input rock, paper, or scissors only!"
